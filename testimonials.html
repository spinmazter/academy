            Today, when I step onto the provincial stage, I carry with me the
            echoes of Coach Kuda’s voice: “Stay focused. Trust your training.
            You’ve got the heart of a champion.” His mentorship is not just seen
            in my trophies but in the resilience etched into my spirit. Thank
            you, Coach Kuda

            Tournaments became our proving grounds. Coach Kuda stood by my side,
            offering tactical insights and calming words during nerve-wracking
            moments. We celebrated victories, it did not take long to make
            provincial team from him teaching me from the very basics.

            I vividly remember the first time I stepped onto the table tennis
            court as a wide-eyed student. Back then, I was just another kid with
            a paddle, chasing after a tiny white ball. Little did I know that
            under coach Kuda's guidance i would become of a provincial champion.
